# Wyrdle (Terminal)

ðŸŸ¡ **Status:** On Hold

A clone of the famous game "Wordle", that runs in the terminal.

I developed this project to study a bit about "[Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)", a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

I intend to use this project as a base to start learning about "[Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)" in the near future, and port this project to mobile devices (for now, this idea is on hold, because I'm studying web development with Django).

## Installation
You can clone this repository using the following command in the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/brohmarr/wyrdle-terminal`

Or simply download the repository as a '.zip', using the green "<> Code" button above.

## Usage
Run the 'main.py' file and start playing! You can check the available words in the 'wordlist.txt' file or change them automatically from another text file using the 'create_wordlist.py' script (you can read its documentation in the file itself).
